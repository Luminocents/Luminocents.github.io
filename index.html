      <h2>Preffered Headsets</h2>
      <p>The headset I use, the headsets that I think to be best, and more on it.</p>
      <p>There are many different VR headsets to get when considering joining VR.
        Some of them being expensive but worth the price, and vice versa.
        Many people think that you need a lot of money for a goof VR experience.
        An expensive desktop PC for one, and an expensive VR headset. But you don't.
        Everyone at this point is aware of the quest 2's existence. It's a VR headset
        made affordable and is actually good. Though it is owned by facebook and
        is required that you link your facebook account. The next headset that has
        been considered the best for a long time is the Valve Index. With
        a pricy tag of $999.99 and it's age, many people think that it will be
        de-throned any time now.</p>
